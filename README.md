decide
======
Are you indecisive? Ever wanted to flip a coin, but didn't have one with you?
Do you dislike playing rock-paper-scissors, because you feel you aren't random enough?

*Indecision, be gone!*

Decide is an app for Glass that allows you to delegate menial decisions (to which you are 
indifferent) to the infinite wisdom of the pseudorandom computational void.
